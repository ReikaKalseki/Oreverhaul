# NauvisDay
Allows much more detailed and more progression-based (and often train-focused) generation of ores.
-----------------
Primary Features:
Allows for gating ore by distance, so that more advanced or lategame ores require further exploration
By default changes richness distribution, so that starter patches are very poor but rapidly improve away from spawn, to encourage trains
Allows for overhauling of spawner/worm placement to mesh with the ore changes

Secondary Features:
Optionally increases spawner health to discourage early game base destruction
Has an option to allow ore richness to increase forever rather than plateauing at maximum distance
Has overall distance scaling options
Has retrogeneration capability, with distance specification
Adds optional Behemoth (green) Worms to defend very distant bases
